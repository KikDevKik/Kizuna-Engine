# Kizuna Engine: System State & Architecture Analysis

## 1. CURRENT STAGE OF EVOLUTION
**Phase:** Phase 7 - The Glass Bridge (World Awareness & Agency)
**Paradigm:** Relational Temporal Knowledge Graph + Multimodal Social Hub

## 2. ACTIVE ARCHITECTURE (The Reality)
*(This section must be strictly updated by The Chronicler whenever a Titan alters the core flow)*
* **Frontend (Forgemaster)**: 3D Revolver Cylinder Roster active. Soul Forge Terminal integrated for ritualistic agent creation. 
* **Database (Chief Architect)**: Relational JSON-LD Ontology active. Explicit Edges (`ParticipatedIn`, `OccurredAt`, `InteractedWith`) replace flat lists.
* **Psychology (Anthropologist)**: Social Battery and Ebbinghaus Decay active. Emotional resonance matrices decoupled from logic.
* **Memory (Soul Architect)**: Hybrid RAG (Recent Episodes + Vector Search + Fact Nodes). Dream consolidation via REM cycles.
* **Concurrency (Bastion)**: Async graph locking via `asyncio.Lock`. Multi-agent state isolation in `LocalSoulRepository`.

## 3. IDENTIFIED SYSTEM FRICTIONS (The Backlog)
*(Instead of a fixed history, list current structural problems that need solving)*
* [ ] **Audio Colissions**: Multiple agents attempting to speak simultaneously over WebSockets. (Pending Chief Architect / Anthropologist routing).
* [ ] **VRAM Optimization**: KV Cache needs sharing across instances. (Pending Bastion).

## 4. RECENT ARCHITECTURAL SHIFTS (Changelog)
* 2026-02-25 - Completed Phase 6: Implemented "District Zero" Hub with 3D Carousel UI and Soul Forge Ritual.
* 2026-02-25 - Completed Phase 5: Shifted from Flat JSON to Relational JSON-LD Ontology with Explicit Edges and Migration Protocols.
* [Date] - Implemented Stochastic Time-Skips.
