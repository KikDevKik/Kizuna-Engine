# Kizuna Engine: System State & Architecture Analysis

## 1. CURRENT STAGE OF EVOLUTION
**Phase:** [e.g., Phase 5 - Autonomous Simulation]
**Paradigm:** [e.g., Temporal Knowledge Graph + Multi-Agent Reality]

## 2. ACTIVE ARCHITECTURE (The Reality)
*(This section must be strictly updated by The Chronicler whenever a Titan alters the core flow)*
* **Frontend (Forgemaster)**: [Current state of audio/vision routing, UI aesthetics]
* **Database (Chief Architect)**: [Current schema, e.g., JSON-LD N-ary relations active]
* **Psychology (Anthropologist)**: [Active mechanics, e.g., Social Battery, Ebbinghaus Decay]
* **Memory (Soul Architect)**: [Current RAG strategy, Dream consolidation logic]
* **Concurrency (Bastion)**: [Active shielding methods, TaskGroups]

## 3. IDENTIFIED SYSTEM FRICTIONS (The Backlog)
*(Instead of a fixed history, list current structural problems that need solving)*
* [ ] **Audio Colissions**: Multiple agents attempting to speak simultaneously over WebSockets. (Pending Chief Architect / Anthropologist routing).
* [ ] **VRAM Optimization**: KV Cache needs sharing across instances. (Pending Bastion).

## 4. RECENT ARCHITECTURAL SHIFTS (Changelog)
* [Date] - Shifted from Flat JSON to Relational JSON-LD Ontology.
* [Date] - Implemented Stochastic Time-Skips.
